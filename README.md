This project requires [Pyton 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

When you first clone the repo, create a virtual environment in the project by running  **python -m venv env**
To activate the env you can then run **.\env\Scripts\activate** in the terminal

To install all the necessary modules you can then run
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

If you have a CUDA-capabale machine you can pip download PyTorch from here https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

If you do not have a CUDA-capable machine then you will still be able to generate audio
but it will be very very slow
